# Audio-classification
Built a audio detecting system to detect whether the audio fed to the model is a dog, cat, cow, bird.


This project involves developing an audio detection system using a feed-forward neural network to classify animal sounds, specifically identifying whether the audio corresponds to a dog, cat, cow, or bird. The model utilizes audio features to achieve accurate multi-class classification
